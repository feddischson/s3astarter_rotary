This is just a very small design to test the Spartan-3an 
starter kit.The intention was to have a small project 
to test the toolchain and the whole 
setup (synthese tools, usb-driver, cable connection)

This small example useses the rotatory-knob increase/decrease  
the LEDs. The center button is used to invert the LED's state

HOWTO synthesis:

There is a small script which takes care of everything, just run
 bash syn.sh
